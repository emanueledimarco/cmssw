To write down the IC in a GT:

cmsRun testReaddbWriteXML_201X.py; where X is the year you need

it will give you an xml output like EcalIntercalibConstants_GR_H_V22.xml.

The .py you use need to have:

1) The GT, ex: GR_H_V22::All
2) The Run number of a good event, ex: firstValue = cms.uint64(177730), lastValue = cms.uint64(177731),
3) And of course take care all the other variable are setted in the right way.

N.B. It has to be done in the DB release, so probably the CMSSW version you use for the Intercalibration wont work.
